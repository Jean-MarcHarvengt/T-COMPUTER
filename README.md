# What is the T-COMPUTER?
The T-COMPUTER is a new micro computer platform supported and powered by the MCUME project.
- It is based on the powerful Teensy4.1 MCU (800+ MHz ARM based, 1MB internal + 8MB QSPI RAM)
- It features: 
  - a 42 keys basic keyboard (including D-PAD controls + 3 buttons)
  - a built-in 320x240 TFT display
  - VGA output 
  - 16 bits stereo DAC output
  - USB host input (for keyboard, mouse, midi devices...)
  - a DB9 digital joystick input (Atari 2600 style joystick)
  - 2 general purpose buttons    
  - 8+6 shared I/O pins for GP usage
  - a SD card slot (from the Teensy 4.1)
- it can be powered over micro USB or can be used as a takeaway system powered by a 1000mA/H lipo.   
- the T-COMPUTER is a DIY project, you can build it yourself and contribute to it!
